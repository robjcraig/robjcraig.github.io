				<div><p>Hi Everyone!  Welcome to my inaugural webpage (built exclusively with good ol' fashioned HTML and CSS) - two things of which I had only heard about in passing. Since I'm in the introductory phase of the program, I can certainly see how overwhelming and complex it may initially seem. Yet it is important to remind oneself that the process of learning anything new never comes easy. I intend to continue to improve upon this site as I become more and more adept at website construction. Please stay tuned for continued updates and thanks for visiting!</p>

				<p>Oh and I would also like to give a big shout out to all of the staff at RCB as they have been extremely encouraging and helpful throughout the program: John, Tom, Evan, Arron, Peter and anyone else I'm missing. Thanks everyone! Rob Craig</p>
